# Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD


today take review about node js after that explaining CI/CD

Continuous integration and continuous delivery explained


is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes

to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.


goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that

passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no 

human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.
